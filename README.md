# Generate TE library using RepeatModeler
When soft masking your genome, using a taxon repeats library (eg. from Dfam) will often result in low masking efficiency because the library lacks the species-specific repeats for your particular species. The presence of unmasked repeats in your genome, especially in high density will impede downstream annotation. Therefore, it is crucial to generate a species-specific repeat library in such cases.

Scripts to generate custom species-specific repeats library can be found here [run_repeatmodeler.sh](https://github.com/kango2/pogors/blob/main/run_repeatmodeler.sh). It can be launched as follows.
```
export workingdir="/path/to/working_directory"
export inputgenome="/path/to/genome.fa"
export species="Species_name"
qsub -P ${PROJECT} -o ${workingdir} -v workingdir=${workingdir},inputgenome=${inputgenome},species=${species} run_repeatmodeler.sh
```
or a one liner
```
qsub -P ${PROJECT} -o /path/to/workingdir -v workingdir=/path/to/workingdir,inputgenome=/path/to/genome.fa,species=Species_name run_repeatmodeler.sh
```
The script will also generate a followup [cleanup.sh] script in your working directory which you can execute to tar up the working directory generated by RepeatModeler.
```
./cleanup.sh
```
